# Unit 5 - Mid-Bootcamp Project

**This is the equator of the Bootcamp, a good moment to check whether our students are well on track** to continue their learning path towards more advanced topics or we need to put in place complementary strategies to set them for success. 

**The students will choose their challenge,** from both algorithms we learned in the past 4 units:

- Use linear regression to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
- Use logistic regression to understand the demographics and other characteristics of a bank customers' that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

# Project | Deliverables

- The students will be required to upload the project on GitHub.
- The repo should be properly organized with specific use of folders and it should follow the naming conventions for folders.
- Make sure that the students update the `Readme.md` file in the repo describing the project, its purpose, and also briefly describing the methodology used to solve the problems.
